## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Game Logic)

1. **Game Initialization**
   - The game starts when the user presses any key.
   - The level is set to `0` and sequences are empty.

2. **Sequence Generation**
   - The game randomly selects a color from `["yellow", "red", "purple", "green"]`.
   - Adds it to the `gameSeq` array.
   - The chosen button flashes to indicate the sequence.

3. **User Input**
   - User clicks buttons to repeat the sequence.
   - Each clicked color is added to the `userSeq` array.
   - Buttons flash visually when clicked.

4. **Answer Checking**
   - Each user input is compared to the corresponding color in `gameSeq`.
   - If the user sequence is correct and complete, the game moves to the next level.
   - If the user makes a mistake, the game displays **Game Over** and resets.

5. **Level Up**
   - Clears the user sequence.
   - Increases the level by 1.
   - Generates the next random color in the sequence.

6. **Reset**
   - Resets the game variables (`started`, `level`, `gameSeq`, `userSeq`) to allow restarting.
